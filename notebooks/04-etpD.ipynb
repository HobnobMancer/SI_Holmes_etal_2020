    "1. Wild Type (`WT`)\n",
    "2. *etpD* knockouts: Î”etpD (`KO`)\n",
    "3. empty plasmid pSE380: (`empty`)\n",
    "4. plasmid pSE380 carrying *etpD* complement: (`complement`)\n",
    "\n",
    "These four variants are each and separately exposed to two spinach plant tissues: *leaf* and *root*, and logCFU determined as described in the manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions at hand are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a difference in logCFU for `KO` with respect to `WT`? If so, what is the direction and magnitude of change?\n",
    "2. Is there a difference in logCFU for `complement` with respect to `empty`? If so, what is the direction and magnitude of change?\n",
    "\n",
    "For each tissue, the experiments were conducted such that each logCFU measurement was acquired on a single, independent plant or leaf. This means that there is **no natural pairing of specific `WT` and `KO`, or `empty` and `complement` measurements**. The natural comparison is within-batch, and pooled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements were made in batches of five. That is, on a particular half-day a batch of ten measurements were made: five `KO` and five `WT`; or five `empty` and five `complement`. There is therefore **no natural pairing of `WT`/`KO` to `empty`/`complement` measurements** as these were carried out in different batches at different times. We may assume that each batch is subject to specific effects that may bias the observed logCFU with respect to other batches."
